# Youtube Problem
I am constantly looking for videos on youtube to learn or test new techniques of relevant topics in data science, but I end up spending a lot of time on this search. I want to use machine learning algorithms to recommend videos that I have a good chance of liking.

# Solution for the situation
With the premise of reducing search time, I will use machine learning algorithms, which, recommend the 5 videos of each relevant subject with greater chances of my liking. The recommendation will be returned through a bot in the telegram, this way I have easy access both by cell phone and computer.

>**This solution involves 3 main steps**
>- Survey of relevant subjects in Data Science.
>- Machine Leraning model construction for video recommendations.
>- Elaboration of the bot in Telegram that performs interaction with the user.

## To survey relevant issues in datascience will be used the StatckExchange (link: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions)
- Stack Exchange is a network of questions and answers (Q&A) on topics in various fields related to datascience, each question covers one or more of a subject through tags
